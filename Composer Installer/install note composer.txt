Windows Installer
The installer will download composer for you and set up your PATH environment variable so you can simply call composer from any directory.

Download and run Composer-Setup.exe - it will install the latest composer version whenever it is executed.

How do I install Composer programmatically?#

As noted on the download page, the installer script contains a signature which changes when the installer code changes and as such it should not be relied upon in the long term.

An alternative is to use this script which only works with UNIX utilities:


#!/bin/sh

EXPECTED_SIGNATURE="$(wget -q -O - https://composer.github.io/installer.sig)"
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
ACTUAL_SIGNATURE="$(php -r "echo hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php');")"

if [ "$EXPECTED_SIGNATURE" != "$ACTUAL_SIGNATURE" ]
then
    >&2 echo 'ERROR: Invalid installer signature'
    rm composer-setup.php
    exit 1
fi

php composer-setup.php --quiet
RESULT=$?
rm composer-setup.php
exit $RESULT



The script will exit with 1 in case of failure, or 0 on success, and is quiet if no error occurs.

Alternatively, if you want to rely on an exact copy of the installer, you can fetch a specific version from GitHub's history. The commit hash should be enough to give it uniqueness and authenticity as long as you can trust the GitHub servers. For example:


wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/composer/getcomposer.org/1b137f8bf6db3e79a38a5bc45324414a6b1f9df2/web/installer -O - -q | php -- --quiet





Command-line installation

To quickly install Composer in the current directory, run the following script in your terminal. To automate the installation, use the guide on installing Composer programmatically.



php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === '544e09ee996cdf60ece3804abc52599c22b1f40f4323403c44d44fdfdd586475ca9813a858088ffbc1f233e9b180f061') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
